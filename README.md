# shortUrl
this is my shorturl project. it is somewhat straight forward. the webpages are not very impressive, and the requirements are pretty lacky too.
many instances where the requirement specifically ask me to redirect users to dead end page.
i could not do the stretch work, i can not figure out how to make the unique visitor thing work.
but that's enough talking from me.

install requirement:
node.js
npm libraries: express, body-parser, cookie-session, bcrypt 2.0.0!, method-override
